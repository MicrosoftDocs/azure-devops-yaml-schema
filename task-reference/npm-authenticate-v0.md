**`workingFile`** - **.npmrc file to authenticate**<br>
`string`. Required.<br>
<!-- :::editable-content name="helpMarkDown"::: -->
The path to the `.npmrc` file that specifies the registries you want to work with. Select the file, not the folder, such as `/packages/mypackage.npmrc`.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<br>

:::moniker-end
<!-- :::item-end::: -->
<!-- :::item name="customEndpoint"::: -->
:::moniker range="<=azure-pipelines"

**`customEndpoint`** - **Credentials for registries outside this organization/collection**<br>
`string`.<br>
<!-- :::editable-content name="helpMarkDown"::: -->
The comma-separated list of [npm service connection](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) names for registries outside this organization or collection.

## Remarks

Use this task to provide `npm` credentials to an `.npmrc` file in your repository for the scope of the build. This enables `npm`, as well as `npm` task runners like gulp and Grunt, to authenticate with private registries.

* [My Pipeline needs to access a feed in a different project](#my-pipeline-needs-to-access-a-feed-in-a-different-project)

### How does this task work?

This task searches the specified `.npmrc` file for registry entries, then appends authentication details for the discovered registries to the end of the file. For all registries in the current organization/collection, the build's credentials are used. For  registries in a different organization or hosted by a third-party, the registry URIs will be compared to the URIs of the [npm service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints#npm-service-connection) specified by the `customEndpoint` input, and the corresponding credentials will be used. The `.npmrc` file will be reverted to its original state at the end of the pipeline execution.

### When in my pipeline should I run this task?

This task must run before you use `npm`, or an `npm` task runner, to install or push packages to an authenticated npm repository such as Azure Artifacts. There are no other ordering requirements.

### I have multiple npm projects. Do I need to run this task for each .npmrc file?

This task will only add authentication details to one `.npmrc` file at a time. If you need authentication for multiple `.npmrc` files, you can run the task multiple times, once for each `.npmrc` file. Alternately, consider creating an `.npmrc` file that specifies all registries used by your projects, running `npmAuthenticate` on this `.npmrc` file, and then setting an environment variable to designate this `.npmrc` file as the npm per-user configuration file.

```YAML
- task: npmAuthenticate@0
  inputs:
    workingFile: $(agent.tempdirectory)/.npmrc
- script: echo ##vso[task.setvariable variable=NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG]$(agent.tempdirectory)/.npmrc
- script: npm ci
  workingDirectory: project1
- script: npm ci
  workingDirectory: project2
```

### My agent is behind a web proxy. Will `npmAuthenticate` set up `npm/gulp/Grunt` to use my proxy?

The answer is no. While this task itself will work behind a web proxy [your agent has been configured to use](/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/proxy), it does not configure `npm` or `npm` task runners to use the proxy.

To do so, you can either:

* Set the environment variables `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` and optionally `no_proxy` to your proxy settings. See [npm config](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy) for details. Note that these are commonly used variables which other non-`npm` tools (e.g. curl) may also use.

* Add the proxy settings to the [npm configuration](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config), either manually, by using [npm config set](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/config#set), or by setting [environment variables](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#environment-variables) prefixed with `NPM_CONFIG_`.
  >**Caution:**  
  >`npm` task runners may not be compatible with all methods of proxy configuration supported by `npm`.

* Specify the proxy with a command line flag when calling `npm`.
  ```YAML
  - script: npm ci --https-proxy $(agent.proxyurl)
  ```

If your proxy requires authentication, you may need to add an additional build step to construct an authenticated proxy URI.

```YAML
- script: node -e "let u = url.parse(`$(agent.proxyurl)`); u.auth = `$(agent.proxyusername):$(agent.proxypassword)`; console.log(`##vso[task.setvariable variable=proxyAuthUri;issecret=true]` + url.format(u))"
- script: npm publish --https-proxy $(proxyAuthUri)
```

### My Pipeline needs to access a feed in a different project

If the pipeline is running in a different project than the project hosting the feed, you must set up the other project to grant read/write access to the build service. See [Package permissions in Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions#pipelines-permissions) for more details.

## Examples

* [Restore `npm` packages for your project from a registry within your organization](#restore-npm-packages-for-your-project-from-a-registry-within-your-organization)
* [Restore and publish `npm` packages outside your organization](#restore-and-publish-npm-packages-outside-your-organization)
* [npmrc](#npmrc)
* [npm](#npm)

### Restore `npm` packages for your project from a registry within your organization

If the only authenticated registries you use are Azure Artifacts registries in your organization, you only need to specify the path to an `.npmrc` file to the `npmAuthenticate` task.

#### `.npmrc`
```
registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/{organization}/_packaging/{feed}/npm/registry/
always-auth=true
```

#### `npm`
```YAML
- task: npmAuthenticate@0
  inputs:
    workingFile: .npmrc
- script: npm ci
# ...
- script: npm publish
```

### Restore and publish `npm` packages outside your organization

If your `.npmrc` contains Azure Artifacts registries from a different organization or use a third-party authenticated package repository, you'll need to set up [npm service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints#npm-service-connection) and specify them in the `customEndpoint` input.
Registries within your Azure Artifacts organization will also be automatically authenticated.

#### `.npmrc`

```
registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_packaging/{feed}/npm/registry/
@{scope}:registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/{otherorganization}/_packaging/{feed}/npm/registry/
@{otherscope}:registry=https://{thirdPartyRepository}/npm/registry/
always-auth=true
```

The registry URL pointing to an Azure Artifacts feed may or may not contain the project. An URL for a project scoped feed must contain the project, and the URL for an organization scoped feed must not contain the project. Learn more about [project scoped feeds](/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/project-scoped-feeds).

#### npm
```YAML
- task: npmAuthenticate@0
  inputs:
    workingFile: .npmrc
    customEndpoint: OtherOrganizationNpmConnection, ThirdPartyRepositoryNpmConnection
- script: npm ci
# ...
- script: npm publish -registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/{otherorganization}/_packaging/{feed}/npm/registry/
```
`OtherOrganizationNpmConnection` and `ThirdPartyRepositoryNpmConnection` are the names of [npm service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints#npm-service-connection) that have been configured and authorized for use in your pipeline, and have URLs that match those in the specified `.npmrc` file.
