<!-- :::item name="batch"::: -->
:::moniker range=">=azure-pipelines-2022.1"

**`batch`** [boolean](boolean.md).<br><!-- :::editable-content name="propDescription"::: -->
The `batch` property configures whether to run the pipeline if the previously scheduled run is in-progress. When `batch` is `true`, a new pipeline run won't start due to the schedule if a previous pipeline run is still in-progress. The default is `false`.

The `batch` property is affected by the setting of the `always` property. When `always` is `true`, the pipeline runs according to the cron schedule, even when `batch` is `true` and there is an in-progress run.

| Always | Batch | Behavior |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `false` | `false` | Pipeline runs only if there's a change with respect to the last successful scheduled pipeline run. |
| `false` | `true` | Pipeline runs only if there's a change with respect to the last successful scheduled pipeline run, and there's no in-progress scheduled pipeline run. |
| `true` | `false` | Pipeline runs according to the cron schedule. |
| `true` | `true` | Pipeline runs according to the cron schedule even if there is an in-progress run. |

## Remarks

If you specify no scheduled trigger, no scheduled builds occur.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify an `exclude` clause without an `include` clause for `branches`, it is equivalent to specifying `*` in the `include` clause.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scheduled triggers defined using the pipeline settings UI take precedence over YAML scheduled triggers.
>
> If your YAML pipeline has both YAML scheduled triggers and UI defined scheduled triggers,
> only the UI defined scheduled triggers are run.
> To run the YAML defined scheduled triggers in your YAML pipeline,
> you must remove the scheduled triggers defined in the pipeline settings UI.
> Once all UI scheduled triggers are removed, a push must be made in order for the YAML
> scheduled triggers to start being evaluated.
>
> To delete UI scheduled triggers from a YAML pipeline, see [UI settings override YAML scheduled triggers](/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#ui-settings-override-yaml-scheduled-triggers).

### Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName variable

When a pipeline is running due to a cron scheduled trigger, the pre-defined `Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName` variable contains the `displayName` of the cron schedule that triggered the pipeline run.

Your YAML pipeline may contain multiple cron schedules, and you may want your pipeline to run different stages or jobs based on which cron schedule runs. For example, you have a nightly build and a weekly build, and you want to run a certain stage only during the nightly build. You can use the `Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName` variable in a job or stage condition to determine whether to run that job or stage.

```yml
- stage: stage1
  # Run this stage only when the pipeline is triggered by the 
  # "Daily midnight build" cron schedule
  condition: eq(variables['Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName'], 'Daily midnight build')
```

## Examples

The following example defines two schedules.

The first schedule, **Daily midnight build**, runs a pipeline at midnight every day only if the code has changed since the last successful scheduled run.
It runs the pipeline for `main` and all `releases/*` branches, except for those branches under `releases/ancient/*`.

The second schedule, **Weekly Sunday build**, runs a pipeline at noon on Sundays for all `releases/*` branches.
It does so regardless of whether the code has changed since the last run.

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: '0 0 * * *'
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - releases/*
    exclude:
    - releases/ancient/*
- cron: '0 12 * * 0'
  displayName: Weekly Sunday build
  branches:
    include:
    - releases/*
  always: true
```

:::moniker range=">azure-pipelines-2022"

To conditionally run a stage or job based on whether it was scheduled by a scheduled trigger, use the `Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName` variable in a condition. In this example, `stage1` only runs if the pipeline was triggered by the `Daily midnight build` schedule, and `job3` only runs if the pipeline was triggered by the `Weekly Sunday build` schedule.

```yml
stages:
- stage: stage1
  # Run this stage only when the pipeline is triggered by the 
  # "Daily midnight build" cron schedule
  condition: eq(variables['Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName'], 'Daily midnight build')
  jobs:
  - job: job1
    steps:
    - script: echo Hello from Stage 1 Job 1

- stage: stage2
  dependsOn: [] # Indicate this stage does not depend on the previous stage
  jobs:
  - job: job2
    steps:
    - script: echo Hello from Stage 2 Job 2
  - job: job3 
    # Run this job only when the pipeline is triggered by the 
    # "Weekly Sunday build" cron schedule
    condition: eq(variables['Build.CronSchedule.DisplayName'], 'Weekly Sunday build')
    steps:
    - script: echo Hello from Stage 2 Job 3
```
