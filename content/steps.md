## Remarks

Each step runs in its own process on an agent and has access to the pipeline workspace on a local hard drive.
This behavior means environment variables aren't preserved between steps but file system changes are.

All tasks and steps support a set of common properties, such as `enabled` and `env`,in addition to their task or step specific properties. For more information on configuring these properties, see [Task control options](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks#task-control-options) and [Task environment variables](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks#environment-variables).
